# Chatroom-Socket.IO
This was a small project designed and developped by myself. It's a TCP/IP chatroom where multiple clients with usernames can talk.
It really is simple to get it all setup. All you need to do is :
            - In 'Client.py', change Server's Ipv4 address

I really hope this github repository was helpful ;)
