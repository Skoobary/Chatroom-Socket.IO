# Chatroom Using Socket.IO [Python]
## This was a small project designed and developped by myself. It's a TCP/IP chatroom where multiple clients with usernames can talk.
#### It really is simple to get it all setup. All you need to do is :
            - In 'Client.py', change Server's Ipv4 address


#### Necessary modules are the following:
```
            - Socket.IO
            - Threading
            - Time
```

Works only on : __Windows__ ; __MacOS__ ; __Linux__
